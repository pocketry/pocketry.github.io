          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <h4>2019-08-04</h4>
          <p>I've been working at a software company as a product owner/manager for about 4 years now. I've learned SQL, Git, Python, HTML and CSS (for very simple modifications).</p>
          <p>I've been saying for a while my next topic should be how to build a website. This is that site. It will be kind of like a blog where I can discuss things I've learned, things I think I want to share, and the journey of learning how to build a multipage website. Today I spent about an hour getting this page layout in decent shape and adding a few links.</p>
          <p>When I started looking at ways to do this easily, I eventually came across <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target = 'blank'>GitHub Pages</a> and thought it would be a great way to start a static site like this one.</p>

          <h2>Project Research</h2>
          <h4>2019-08-15</h4>
          <p>After I spent some time getting the layout here into a state that I was satisfied with, I began thinking about how to upkeep that layout if I'm supporting multiple pages. If my posts were going to be on pages with unique, permanent URLs then I would need a way to keep the title, sidebar, and general layout in sync accross all the pages.</p>
          <p>I knew this was a problem that has many readily available solutions, but before I started doing research I wanted to think about how I could do it. I thought I could use a little javascript to insert some master html into every page. I quickly realized that the javascript to keep a multipage site consistent is a little hacky. Based on some of the advice I had seen on <a href="https://tildes.net" target = 'blank'>tildes.net</a>, I should be doing this with little to no javascript. Since I was building a static pages and don't need a database, I didn't think I would need any kind of server code. Then I found out about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system" target = 'blank'></a>static site generators.</p>
          <p>I should have figured this out sooner because GitHub Pages is based on Jekyll. I can't believe I didn't see it right away. I don't want to stick with GitHub pages because I want to learn how to setup and mantain a web server. I decided to go with <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/" target = 'blank'>Pelican</a> since I'm already the most familiar with python. Here are the next several tasks I see that need to be accomlished.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pick a domain name I like</li>
            <li>Create a "Hello World" site with Pelican</li>
            <li>Deploy said site to a server (This is probably going to take the longest because I have the most to learn. I'm going to be using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target = 'blank'>DigitalOcean</a> to host.)</li>
            <li>Port this over to Pelican</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I'll be trying to keep this page up to date as I work through this since this will probably take a while and I don't dedicate a ton of time to this.</p>
          <p>With this post I've also updated how I'm getting my css for this page because I was getting some errors due to the external styelsheet I was trying to use has http for fonts instead of https. Then I learned that you have to put <code>@import url()</code> statements at the top of a css file.</p>
          <p>Small side note: I've been using Atom so far to work on this, but I've been using VS Code at work for my python projects and really like it. I'm eventually going to get it setup on my home computer to use it to work on this.</p>
