        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h4>2019-08-04</h4>
        <p>I've been working at a software company as a product owner/manager for about 4 years now. I've learned SQL, Git, Python, HTML and CSS (for very simple modifications).</p>
        <p>I've been saying for a while my next topic should be how to build a website. This is that site. It will be kind of like a blog where I can discuss things I've learned, things I think I want to share, and the journey of learning how to build a multipage website. Today I spent about an hour getting this page layout in decent shape and adding a few links.</p>
        <p>When I started looking at ways to do this easily, I eventually came across <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target = 'blank'>GitHub Pages</a> and thought it would be a great way to start a static site like this one.</p>
